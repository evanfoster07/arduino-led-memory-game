# Arduino-LED-Memory-Game
An Arduino-based LED memory game where players repeat an LED sequence.
The game generates an increasing sequence of LED flashes which the user must repeat via Serial input.

## Overview
This project implements a simple embedded memory game using an Arduino.
Each round, a new LED is added to the sequence. The sequence is displayed to the user via LEDs, who must then repeat it correctly.
Incorrect input resets the game and the user recieves a lose message, while successfully repeating the entire sequence results in a win.

## Features 
- Random LED sequence generation
- Increasing difficulty with each round
- Customizable sequence length
- Safe array bounds handling for microcontroller memory constraints
- Modular game logic (sequence generation, win/lose display, input handling)

## Hardware Used
- Arduino board (Uno or compatible)
- 3 LEDs
- 3 current-limiting resistors (220Ω)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## How it Works
- The player is prompted for their desired sequence length via the Serial Monitor.
- The LED sequence is stored in a fixed-size array.
- Each round adds a new randomly generated value (1-3). 
- The full sequence is flashed via LEDs corresponding to values 1, 2, or 3.
- User input is read by the Serial Monitor and validated step-by-step.
- Both incorrect input and completion reset the game state.
- User is informed of win or loss conditions through Serial output and LED flashing.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the '.ino' file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Ensure proper wiring & pin connections.
4. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
5. Open the Serial Monitor (9600 baud).
6. Enter LED sequence values one at a time.
